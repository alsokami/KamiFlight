# Kami Flight

This is the one and only **kamiflight** plugin. 
This plugin allows players to fly as they will.
**NOTE: THIS PLUGIN IS MAINLY CODED FOR 1.20.4 IF YOU USE VIAVERSION OR ANY OTHER VIA PLUGINS, YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER ERRORS. I HAVE NOT ON MY PART. MAY VARY ON USERS.**

# PERMISSION MANAGEMENT

In order to allow players to fly, you need to enable the **kamiflight.fly** permission.

# SIMPLE, YET EFFECTIVE

The plugin is simply very lightweight and simply coded for it to be toggleable using an array list where the players are stored if they have enabled flight. If they have, then used the command, it will be toggled off. If they are not in the list and used the command, flight will be toggle on.
